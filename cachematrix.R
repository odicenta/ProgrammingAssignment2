## Calculates the inverse of a matrix. In order to save time and resources, 
## first check if the inverse already exists from previous operations, if so
## it loads it from the cache, if not, it calculates it and stores it in 
## cache for later use.

## This helper function creates a special matrix that:
## 1. Set the matrix
## 2. Get the matrix
## 3. Set the inverse of the matrix
## 4. Get the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function calculates the inverse of a matrix using the makeCacheMatrix function
## if the matrix already exists, it retrieves it from the cache, if not, it calculates 
## the inverse and store it for later use.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
